## My process
HTML
- I created a div conatianer for everything so that i can be able to use flexbox to controll the layout .
- I also created a div sub-contianer for the image.
- I also created a second contianer which i name "container2" and made sure it was inside the maine contianer .
- Inside the "contianer2" : - I inserted two paragraph .
                            - I inserted a span inside the first paragraph so that i would be able to change the color of a specific text given by the challange.
                            
- I also created another div called number inside container2
- Inside my Number div i inserted a ul tag that enabled me to list out the required text givine to me by the challange
- I inside my ul tag i inserted a br tag and a p tag to enable my work look exactly like the challange.


Css
- I first of all created my mobile layout first 
- then i used the filter design which i newly leanrnt to add an opacity to make the image look exactly like the one in the challange 
- I used flexbox to arrange my li's both in the moble view and desktop view
- i used media quires to make my desktop view 
- in my desktop view i made use of the flexbos which i put in the main contianer class to position  it as the challange demmanded



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google font 


### What I learned

I learnt how to :
- use the filter in css to edite a picture .
- i also learnt that position relative and absolute is relivant to position element in html.

```css
#pic{
    filter: opacity(50%)
}
```

### Continued development

 - woul definetly continue to use media quries to master how to use Max-width and Min-width.
 - I would also continue to use fitlter to edite picture to master it 



### Useful resources

- resource 1: (https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_filter.asp) 
- This helped me  to be able to use filter to edite my picture . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
